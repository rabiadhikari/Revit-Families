# Revit-Families
Revit Families are in the Example Files. Editing the families from Family Browser in the example file and loading the family into your projects ensure all types are copied into your project. 

Instructions for Parking Example Share file:

1) These are line based parking families which can be hosted in any workplane.
2) Start has a little circle to indicate beginning of the line.
3) End has a little vertical dash to indicate end of measured nearest parking spot. This vertical dash can be used to align component for clean modeling.
4) Once a component is placed, selecting and dragging it allows for easy aligning with nearby other components.
5) For Accessible parking component, graphics is designed for two parking spots. Ensure the line length is matched with the second spot vertical dash.
6) The parking lot aisle and the sidewalk aisle are instance parameters. 
7) The accessible parking aisle parameter is an instance parameter.
8) The reference lines can be hidden by setting type parameter value.
9) The accessible symbol can be set and oriented by setting Flip Symbol which is an instance parameter.
10) I have created 30, 45, 60, 75 & 90 degrees types. Each type has appropriate hatch pattern that represents accessible aisle hatch.
